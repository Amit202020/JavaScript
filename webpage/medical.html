                            Cataracts are a painless clouding of the internal lens of your eye. Because they block light from passing through the lens, cataracts make it difficult to see clearly and can even cause blindness over time. Cataracts are progressive, meaning they worsen with time. Most cases occur in older people, but sometimes they can be seen in younger people as well.

                            Light enters your eye and passes through the lens. The lens of your eye focuses light onto the retina, which transmits visual signals through the optic nerve to your brain. Clouding of the lens due to cataracts results in blurring of the images you see. Other problems with the eyes can also cause blurry vision, but cataracts produce some characteristic symptoms.

                           The most common symptom of cataracts is seeing blurry images at any distance. People may describe their vision as foggy, cloudy, or filmy. Cataracts get worse with time, and less light reaches the retina. It may be especially hard for people with cataracts to see and drive at night.

                    <p>Glare, or sensitivity to light, is another symptom of cataracts. It can be difficult for a person with cataracts to see in bright sunlight. Indoor lights may begin to seem too bright, or they may appear to have halos around them. Glare from oncoming headlights can cause problems with driving at night.</p>

                    <p>Diplopia, or double vision, when looking with one eye can be another symptom of cataracts. This is not the same as diplopia that arises from improper alignment of your eyes. The double vision seen with cataracts occurs even when you look through only one eye.</p>

                    <p>Cataracts also affect color vision. Some colors may appear faded, and things may acquire a yellowish or brownish tint. This may not be noticed at first, but with time, distinguishing between blues and purples can be difficult.</p>
