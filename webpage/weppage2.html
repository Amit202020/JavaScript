        <article>To be truly eco-sustainable, a manufacturing company must take into consideration two fundamental aspects:
          the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the circular economy.
          In the first part of this blog serie, I will explain how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and how it is possible
          to become carbon neutral.<article>
				<article>The carbon footprint is the set of all greenhouse gas emissions due to the combustion of fossils that a company
         generates directly and/or indirectly in manufacturing a product or providing a service.
        The carbon footprint includes the quantification of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the life cycle of the
        product, from the extraction of raw materials to the final disposal of the product.<article>
